What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git file created. I need to instruct  Git to start collect Meta-data in side the directory,files,subdirectory.

How is the staging area is different from the working directory and the Repository? what value
do you think it offers?

staging area is a middle zone that i can add my changes to it.
this gives me the power to create a commit grouping only the logical changes i need.

the working directory contains all my current changes without a snapshot for changes.
the Repository contain all my commit, that gives my the power to go  back to previous changes.
