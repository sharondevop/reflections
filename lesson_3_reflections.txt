When would you want to use a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?

      When I need to share my project with more people all over the internet.
      I can save a backup on a remote repository, and access it for any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

      When I work locally I want to be in control in my changes.
      If a developer change the code on the remote repository, i wanna know
      what im pulling to my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. when would you
use one instead on another?

    forks is used only on GitHub platform, i will use fork when i need clone a repository from a user
    on GitHub and add it to my Github account. this way i can use the user repository as is was created by me.

    clones is used for copy a repository from GitHub to my local machine.
    it allow me to add, commit the repository locally.

    branches are used locally and remotely to logically groups commit.
    branches are a fancy name for tag a logical commit group, I can use branch for different part in my code.
    e.g., fix a bug, working on a new feature.
