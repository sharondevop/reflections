When would you want to use a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?

      When I need to share my project with more people all over the internet.
      I can save a backup on a remote repository, and access it for any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

      When I work locally I want to be in control in my changes.
      If a developer change the code on the remote repository, i wanna know
      what im pulling to my local repository.
