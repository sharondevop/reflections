How did viewing a diff between two versions off a file help you see the bug hat was introduced?
diff compare for me the two versions and showed me where the was changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can see what the is the root cause for a Bug by viewing code changes.
I can track changes on my Code.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros are:
I have a full control when is the right time for me to save my changes.


The cons are:
I need to remember to save my work, if not I can lose my changes.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git part of version control system focus on the needs of development.
And been built to provide a solution for them.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for ?
I want to use Git to store and share my code,projects, knowledge. and demonstrate my writing code skill by sharing it on Git.
